Ideas Wanted
============

The goal of this repo is to catalog ideas for talks, old and new. Adding a talk doesn't obligate you to create or give a talk, it's merely a contribution to the collective conscience.

If ever anyone wishes to give a talk, but doesn't know about what to talk, this list should provide some ideas.  Furthermore, it may clue someone in that something they know may be of interest to others.


How To Contribute
=================

Please just fork this small repo, make the changes you want, then issue a pull request.

There is not a whole lot to this repo other than the list in the README.md

If you add a topic that you would be willing to speak about or see another topic that you would be willing to speak about, please add your github username.

Thank you,
estrabd
